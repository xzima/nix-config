## To access a version 3 Onion Service with client authorization as a client, make sure you have ClientOnionAuthDir set in your torrc

## When this option is set, we don’t listen for or accept any connections other than controller connections,
## and we close (and don’t reattempt) any outbound connections. Controllers sometimes use this option to avoid using
## the network until Tor is fully configured. Tor will make still certain network-related calls (like DNS lookups)
## as a part of its configuration process, even if DisableNetwork is set. (Default: 0)
#DisableNetwork 1

## Configuration options can be imported from files or folders using the %include
## option with the value being a path. This path can have wildcards. Wildcards are
## expanded first, using lexical order. Then, for each matching file or folder, the following
## rules are followed: if the path is a file, the options from the file will be parsed as if
## they were written where the %include option is. If the path is a folder, all files on that
## folder will be parsed following lexical order. Files starting with a dot are ignored. Files
## on subfolders are ignored.
## The %include option can be used recursively.
%include /etc/tor/bridges
